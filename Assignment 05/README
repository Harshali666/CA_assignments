We have to calculate values of x1, x2, x3, x4.
We take it as 
A.X = B
we will perform the operation on A to calculate L & O.
Now calculate 
L.Y = B
we get matrix Y, use it to calculate X. From equation U.X = Y, we get X.
This is result of LU decomposition.

Parallel Approach
We can make use of parallelism to calculate L & U.
We can use MPI to calculate L & U.
Distribute the matrix A to different processors.
Thus we can calculate L & U in parallel.
